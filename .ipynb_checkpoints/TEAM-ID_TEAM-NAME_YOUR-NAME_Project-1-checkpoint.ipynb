    "In this project, we are going to use a non-linear weighted least squares optimization approach to solve the problem of getting a better estimate of our robot's trajectory. Least squares formulations are widely used for optimization, be it computer vision or robotics or machine learning. We will dive deep into it during this project and you will have complete clarity on optimization for vector-valued residual functions. \n",

    "In this \"Introduction\" section, I am going to provide an introduction for SLAM problem for a robot operating in the 2D world. It is 2. section in this Project. The 1D SLAM problem (1.) is far much simpler to understand and will be described directly in the 1. section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2D world, a robot has 3 degrees of freedom, i.e. its pose in the world can be expressed by the state vector $\\mathbf{x}=(x, y, \\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}}$. For the scope of this project, we are interested only in the robot's trajectory through the $2 \\mathrm{D}$ world, and NOT in distinct landmarks or the surronding map of the environment, i.e. we are only interested in \"L\"ocalization part of SLAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can represent it as a graph where the vertices represent robot poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and edges represent the spatial constraints between these poses. Such a map is generally called a pose graph.\n",

    "Two different kinds of constraints are necessary for pose graph SLAM. The first are\n",
    "odometric constraints that connect two successive states $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}$ via a motion model. Furthermore, in order to perform loop closing, the robot has to recognize places it already visited before. This place recognition is also a part of the front-end and provides the second type of constraint, the loop closure constraints. These constraints connect two not necessarily successive poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{j}$.\n",

    "A robot is travelling in a oval trajectory. It is equipped with wheel odometry for odometry information and RGBD sensors for loop closure information. Due to noise in wheel odometry it generates a noisy estimate of the trajectory. Our task is to use loop closure pairs to correct the drift.\n",

    "1. Initial position\n",

However, you still have to separately calculate it analytically and verify if it matches with `jax`'s `jacobian` using [[CP-M]] frobenius norm `frobNorm()`). Calculation and verification is compulsory, but it is your choice to use whichever as part of your optimization. Use whichever is faster.\n",

However, you have to _heavily_ experiment with these values. (Given that you somehow know loop closure information is way more reliable than odometry.). At the end of your experimentation, your error $F = \\frac{1}{2}  \\mathbf{f}^{\\top} \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} $ should by < 40. Explain your experimentation in detail using tables/plots etc if necessary.\n",

    "Do not worry if you're not getting a perfect trajectory. Our parametrization was oversimplified for the sake of this project. With that being said, it is possible to get the error down to < 40 and make it at least look like an oval shaped trajectory, even if it doesn't perfectly resemble the ground truth. However, using `g2o` (next section), you will be getting a close to ground truth trajectory."

    "Give a detailed answer addressing the above questions. When I run the above code, it should follow points described above (such as plots at every 10 steps) and (When I run the above code, it should) write the optimized poses to a file named `opt.g2o`. As a backup, save another file `opt_backup.g2o` in an offline manner beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "That apart, save important plots and add them here so that it can supplement your answer, for example you could add plots at crucial stages of optimization. You have to add useful metrics/plots from `EVO` (refer to supplementary notebook). Using EVO, the bare minimum you have to report is `mean absolute pose error (ape)` and `mean relative pose error (rpe)`. However, you are encouraged to use tools like `evo_traj` and [more](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo/#command-line-interface) and add more plots/metrics. Marks will be awarded based on overall analysis & presentation which would reflect your understanding.\n",

    "Note that `EVO` and `g2o_viewer` (below) could help you in debugging."
